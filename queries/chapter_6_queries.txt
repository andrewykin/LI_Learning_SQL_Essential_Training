Chapter 6 - Joins
How tables share a relationship:
- JOIN - command that combines fields from two or more tables of a relational database 
- ERD - Entity Relationship Diagram - graphical representation of tables

Invoice & Customer tables share CustomerID columns 
- Customer table has CustomerID as a primary key 
- Invoice table has CustomerID as a foreign key 

JOINs require tablename.columnname/fieldname syntax
- often use aliases to reduce typing
*/
-- JOIN Customer & Invoice Tables
SELECT *
FROM Invoice
INNER JOIN Customer
ON Invoice.CustomerId = Customer.CustomerId
ORDER BY Customer.CustomerId

-- JOIN w/ Aliasing
SELECT 
	c.LastName,
	c.FirstName,
	i.InvoiceId,
	i.CustomerId,
	i.InvoiceDate,
	i.total
FROM Invoice AS i
INNER JOIN Customer AS c
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
ORDER BY c.CustomerId

/* 
How we've used JOIN clauses
- Accessed fields in multiple tables
- Identified primary keys
- Identified similar foreign keys
- Used ON keyword to link the tables together

What if the data doesn't match?
- discrepancies between tables are handled with different join types

INNER JOIN
- Only returns matching records, unmatched data from either table is ignored
- Represents only the overlapping sections of Venn Diagram
- Most commonly used, to bring corresponding data together from different tables in a relational database 

LEFT OUTER JOIN
- Combines all the records from the left table and any matching records from the right TABLE
  - left & right depends on order listed in SQL statement
  
RIGHT OUTER JOIN 
- right outer joins are not supported in SQLite, but popular so in other Relational Database Management Systems
- Mirror image of the LEFT OUTER JOIN
  - Returns RIGHT table & matching information from LEFT table

Chapter Quiz
1. Which statement best describes a Left Outer Join?
	Answer: It returns all records from the left table with any matching records from the right table.
2. Which statement best describes an Inner Join?
	Answer: It returns only matching records from two or more tables.
3. Using the Browse Data tab or the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the database; take a look at the tracks table. Identify which fields in this table are foreign keys of another table.
	Answer: AlbumId, MediaTypeId, and GenreId
