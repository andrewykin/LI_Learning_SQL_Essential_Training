-- SELECT clause subquery | Gather data about all invoices that are less than thish average?
SELECT
	InvoiceDate,
	BillingAddress,
	BillingCity,
	total
FROM
	Invoice
WHERE 
	total <
		(select avg(total) from Invoice)
ORDER BY
	total DESC 
-- invoice total average is $8.06
-- the portion inside the parentheses is called the Inner Query, the rest is Outer Query 

-- Aggregated subqueries | How is each individual city performing against the global average sales?
SELECT
	BillingCity,
	round(avg(total),2) AS [City Average],
	(select round(avg(total),2) from Invoice) AS [Global Average]
FROM
	Invoice
GROUP BY
	BillingCity
ORDER BY
	BillingCity
	
-- Subqueries without Agregate functions | 
SELECT
	InvoiceDate,
	BillingAddress,
	BillingCity
FROM
	Invoice
WHERE
	InvoiceDate >
		(SELECT
		  InvoiceDate
		 FROM
		  Invoice
		 WHERE
		  InvoiceId = 251)

-- IN clause subquery | 
SELECT
	InvoiceDate,
	BillingAddress,
	BillingCity
FROM
	Invoice
WHERE
	InvoiceDate IN 
(SELECT
	InvoiceDate
FROM
	Invoice
WHERE
	InvoiceId IN (251, 252, 254))

-- DISTINCT clause subquery | Which tracks are not selling?
SELECT
